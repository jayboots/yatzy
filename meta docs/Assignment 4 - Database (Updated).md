# Assignment 4: Web Application

Students will build their own web application
using the approaches learned in class. In the assignment, a database [Postgres (or similar)] will be created and accessed.

## Objectives

* Build this application and add the link to your profile

To build a web application based on the learnings in the course.
You will use your GitHub repository (e.g. `emergency_waitlist`)
to build this web application using the core
skills learned in this course including:

* HTML/CSS for front end design (make sure to add to the profile)
* JavaScript for client side interactions
* PHP (or similar) for server side interactions
* Postgres (or similar) for managing data ( this is important)

## Sample Application

"Add this to your web application ( from A1 to A3)"



 * use one of these two options :
  1. Hospital application : The Hospital Triage application helps staff and patients better understand wait times while in the emergency room.  The application will be administered by the triage staff based on two dimensions: severity of injuries and the length of time already in the queue.  Administratorâ€™s will see the full list of patients.
  1. Or you can improve your project by adding a database instead of adding the hospital triage application, add users and their information, like their names, usernames and locations. (Not not add users authentification)
 
## Deliverables

You will submit all code in your GitHub code repository (e.g. `emergency_waitlist`).

* 
1. You will provide a `README.md` to describe your application both from a developers perspective (how to setup/run it locally). And, from the user perspective (how to use the application). The user documentation should include details from both the `admin's` and `patient's` perspective.

1. If you improved your applications, then a similar level of complexity is required where you as an administrator can manage data separately from your users accessing (and to some extent also inputting) that data.

You will add a technical (and visual) outline in your portfolio projects section.
