<p>Students will enhance their Yatzy game to have a PHP server component for managing the scoring by using AJAX to communicate between the HTML/CSS/JS client with the PHP server.</p>
<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<p>You will enhance your single-player <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yatzy">Yatzy Game</a> by adding a PHP server component to your <code>yatzy</code> GitHub code repository based on your models built during the labs.</p>
<p>You will expose the Yatzy game functionality through a JSON API, and update your JavaScript to make AJAX calls to your newly created API.</p>
<p>All game state should be stored on the PHP server (you can store that information in the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.session.php">PHP $_SESSION</a>) and your HTML/CSS/JavaScript should focus on displaying the current state of the game (the JavaScript should NOT calculate scores or track progress, just display the current state).</p>
<p>You will track a game leaderboard showing your top 10 scores. For simplicity, this information can also be stored in the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.session.php">PHP $_SESSION</a>.</p>
<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
<p>Consider keeping a copy of the original JS version (in <code>/versions/v01</code>) of the game before making changing for this assignment.</p>
<p>You will submit all code in your <code>yatzy</code> GitHub code repository. You will update your <code>README.md</code> to update how your game works and screenshots of the various user interface states.</p>
<p>You will be graded on the following criteria.</p>
