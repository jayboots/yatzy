<p>Students will build their own web application
using the approaches learned in class. In the assignment, a database [Postgres (or similar)] will be created and accessed </p>
<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<p>###Build this application and add the link to your profile</p>
<p>To build a web application based on the learnings in the course.
You will use your GitHub repository (e.g. <code>emergency_waitlist</code>)
to build this web application using the core
skills learned in this course including:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML/CSS for front end design (make sure to add to the profile)</li>
<li>JavaScript for client side interactions</li>
<li>PHP (or similar) for server side interactions</li>
<li>Postgres (or similar) for managing data ( this is important)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sample-application">Sample Application</h2>
<p>&quot;Add this to your web application ( from A1 to A3)&quot;</p>
<p>The Hospital Triage application helps staff and patients
better understand wait times while
in the emergency room.  The application will be administered
by the triage staff based on two dimensions: severity of injuries
and the length of time already in the queue.  Administratorâ€™s will
see the full list of patients, but users can sign-in with their
name and 3-letter code showing an approximate wait time, which is
updated as patients are treated.</p>
<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
<p>You will submit all code in your GitHub code repository (e.g. <code>emergency_waitlist</code>).</p>
<p>You will provide a <code>README.md</code> to describe
your application both from a developers perspective (how to setup/run
it locally). And, from the user perspective (how to use the application).
The user documentation should include details from both the
<code>admin&#39;s</code> and <code>patient&#39;s</code> perspective.</p>
<p>If you create your own application, then a similar level of complexity is required
where you as an administrator can manage data separately from your users
accessing (and to some extent also inputting) that data.</p>
<p>You will add a technical (and visual) outline in your portfolio projects
section.</p>
