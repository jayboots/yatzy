## Learning Objectives

* Experience with HTML Canvas
* Experience with manipulating graphics with JavaScript
* Experience with modelling a simple game physics

## Tasks

This is an individual lab in your `csi3x40_labs`
repository from previous labs.

### 1. Set Up Your Project

Create a directory `lab10`
(our working directory for this lab)
and commit a `index.html` file with the game presented in
class `canvas/25_final.html`.

### 2. Improve on the Jump Game

Improve on the game presented in class.
You can start by splitting the index.html into three files

* index.html (just the HTML)
* model.js (the game model)
* events.js (the events that bind the HTML to the game model)
* styles.css (any game styling)

Possible improvements include

* Add a score, or add health to the player
* Make it multi-player (one after the other, or at the same time)
* Keep track of a high score
* Create other obstacles (birds, animals, airplanes)
  * Add coins or other objects to collection (fruits or gold)
* Add other elements to the landscape
  * More shapes for the trees
  * Clouds
  * Gradients in the sky or in the grass
* Add an “end” to the game (like Mario Run) or make it infinite (like Temple Run)

### 3. Document the upgrades

Document your upgrades and include
screenshots of the enhanced game.  You will also
give a demo of their work to the TA.
